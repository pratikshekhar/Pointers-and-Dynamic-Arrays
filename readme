This readme file is for all the programs for lab 1. There are five programs in total and named as question1.c, question2.c, question3.c, question4.c and question5.c respectively. 

All the programs are written in C language, so in order to test the program, knowledge of both C and pointers are necessary.

I have created a Makefile to run the programs. In order to run any program, the tester must type the following command in the terminal for each questions:
 	
	  make prob<type question_Number here> 

For example: In order to run the first program, the tester must write 
	"make ques1" and press enter. 
	    Similarly for second program, the tester must write 
	"make ques2" and press enter.

In order to run program in a different manner, the tester must first compile each program using the following command:

	For example: to run question 1,
	the tester must first compile question1.c by typing the following:

	gcc -o question1 question1.c

	Once question1.c is compiled, the tester must write the following to execute it:
	
	./question1


NOTE: The program will not run if it doesn't compile. However in this case all the programs are working and hence will compile without any errors. 


I'm fairly new to C and therefore had to teach my self pointer over the weekend to finish this lab. I really enjoyed it a lot. I would also like to mention that I took help from few of my class mates, TA's and StackOver flow in order to     understand certain concepts in C and make my program working.
